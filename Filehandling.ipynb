        "\"\"\"1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "--> Interpreted: Code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter (like Python). It is generally easier to debug but slower to execute.\n",
        "Compiled: The entire source code is converted into machine code by a compiler (like C++) before execution. This results in faster performance but longer development cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "--> Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors gracefully using try, except, else, and finally blocks without crashing the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "--> The finally block contains code that will always execute, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's typically used for cleanup operations like closing files, releasing resources, or closing database connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "-->Logging is a means of tracking events that happen during program execution. It provides a way to record information about the program's behavior, errors, warnings, and other significant events to files or other output destinations.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "--> The __del__ method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected. It's used to perform cleanup operations before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "--> import module: Imports the entire module; you must use module.function() to access its contents.\n",
        "from module import function: Imports specific attributes or functions directly into the current namespace, allowing you to use function() directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "--> You can handle multiple exceptions using multiple except blocks for different exception types, or by using a single except block with a tuple of exception types.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "--> The with statement is used for resource management (context managers). It ensures that resources like files are automatically closed after the block of code is finished, even if an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "--> Multithreading: Multiple threads run within the same memory space. Best for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
        "Multiprocessing: Multiple processes run in separate memory spaces. Best for CPU-bound tasks as it bypasses the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "--> Logging helps in debugging, tracking application flow, monitoring errors, and maintaining logs without interrupting program execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "--> Memory management in Python involves the allocation and deallocation of memory for objects. Python automatically manages memory through its private heap space where all objects are stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "--> Basic steps in exception handling:\n",
        "Try: Wrap the risky code.\n",
        "Except: Catch and handle specific errors.\n",
        "Else: Execute code if no errors occurred.\n",
        "Finally: Execute cleanup code.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "--> Memory management is crucial to prevent memory leaks, ensure efficient resource utilization, maintain application performance, and prevent out-of-memory errors. Poor memory management can lead to application crashes, reduced system performance, and wasted resources, especially in long-running applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "--> The try block contains code that might raise an exception. The except block catches and handles specific exceptions that occur in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "--> Python primarily uses Reference Counting (deleting objects when their reference count hits zero) and a Generational Garbage Collector to find and fix reference cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "--> The else block in a try-except statement executes only if the code in the try block does not raise an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "--> The common logging levels in order of increasing severity are: DEBUG (detailed diagnostic information), INFO (general informational messages), WARNING (indication of potential problems), ERROR (serious problems that prevented a function from executing), and CRITICAL (very serious errors that may cause the program to terminate).\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "--> os.fork(): A Unix-specific system call that creates a child process by copying the parent.\n",
        "multiprocessing: A cross-platform Python module that provides a higher-level API for spawning processes.\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "--> Closing a file frees up system resources and ensures that all buffered data is physically written to the disk.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "--> file.read() reads the entire file content as a single string (or specified number of bytes).\n",
        "file.readline() reads a single line from the file including the newline character. read() is memory-intensive for large files, while readline() is more memory-efficient for processing files line by line.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "--> It provides a flexible framework for generating log messages from Python programs, allowing output to be directed to various destinations (console, files, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "--> The os module provides functions for interacting with the operating system for file and directory operations. It includes functions to check file existence, create/delete directories, get file information, navigate the file system, manipulate file paths, and perform low-level file operations that are platform-independent.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "--> Challenges include managing memory for large data structures, dealing with circular references that can delay garbage collection, memory fragmentation in long-running applications, the overhead of reference counting, difficulty in predicting when objects will be deleted, and limited control over when garbage collection occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.  How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "--> You raise an exception manually using the raise keyword followed by an exception instance or exception class. For example: raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\") or raise Exception(). You can raise built-in exceptions or create custom exceptions by inheriting from the Exception class.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "--> It allows for concurrent execution, which is crucial for maintaining a responsive user interface or handling multiple network requests simultaneously without blocking the main program.\n",
