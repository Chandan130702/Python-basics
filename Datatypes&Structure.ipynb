        " -> Data structures are organized ways of storing and managing data so it can be accessed and modified efficiently. It also helps in organizing, storing, and managing data in a computer's memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n",
        "-> Mutable data types can be modified after creation without creating a new object (e.g., list, dictionary, set).Immutable data types cannot be changed once created. Any modification creates a new object in memory(e.g., int, float, str, tuple).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "-> Mutability:Lists allow modifications such as adding, removing, or changing elements at any time.Tuples remain fixed once defined; you cannot alter their contents or size.​\n",
        "Syntax: Lists use square brackets: [1, 2, 3].​Tuples use parentheses: (1, 2, 3).​\n",
        "Performance and Memory: Lists are slower and consume more memory because they are dynamic and flexible.​Tuples are faster and more memory efficient due to their immutability and fixed size.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "-> Dictionary use key value pairs to store data.Each key is hashed to generate an index where the corresponding value is stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "-> Sets automatically remove duplicate items, ensuring all elements are unique, whereas lists can contain duplicates.​\n",
        "Set elements are unordered, so their positions are not preserved, while lists maintain element order.​\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "-> A string is an immutable sequence of characters used to represent text.\n",
        "Unlike lists:\n",
        "Strings are immutable; lists are mutable.\n",
        "Strings contain only characters; lists can hold any data type.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "-> Tuples are immutable, so their values cannot be changed, ensuring the stored data remains constant.Once created, their elements cannot be modified, added, or removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "-> A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. Python dictionaries are implemented as hash tables. When you insert a key-value pair, Python computes a hash of the key to determine where to store the value in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "-> Yes, Python lists can contain elements of different data types in the same list.\n",
        "Ex: [1, \"hello\", 3.14, True, [1, 2]] is a valid list containing an integer, string, float, boolean, and another list.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n",
        "-> Strings are immutable in Python because once created, their value cannot be changed in memory. This design improves performance and makes strings safe to use as keys in dictionaries. If you try to modify a string, Python actually creates a new one instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "-> Dictionaries offer faster data access because they store values using keys instead of positions. They’re ideal when you need to look up, add, or modify data quickly based on a unique key. They also help organize data in a key–value format, making it easier to understand and manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
        "-> Using a tuple is preferable when you want to store data that should not change, such as a person’s date of birth, id, or name. Tuples protect the data from being accidentally modified, ensuring it stays constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "-> Sets automatically remove duplicates and store only unique items. When you add an element that already exists in the set, the operation is ignored, and the set remains unchanged.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "-> The “in” keyword checks whether a value exists in a list by searching through its elements. But in a dictionary, “in” checks for keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n",
        "-> No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple because tuples are immutable. This means their content is fixed once created, so you cannot change, add, or remove items. This immutability helps protect data that should stay constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "-> A nested dictionary is a dictionary that contains another dictionary inside it as a value.\n",
