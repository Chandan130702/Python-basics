        "\"\"\"1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "--> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which represent real-world entities.(methods).\n",
        "It is based on four core principles: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "--> A class is a blueprint or a prototype from which objects are created. It is a user-defined data type that holds its own data members (attributes or variables) and member functions (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It's a concrete entity created from a class blueprint that has its own unique state (attribute values) while sharing the structure and behavior defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "--> Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object to the user. It focuses on what the object does.\n",
        "Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping the data (attributes) and the code (methods) together as a single unit, and also restricting direct access to some of the object's components. It focuses on how the object does it, protecting the internal state.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "--> Dunder methods (double underscore methods) are special methods with names surrounded by double underscores, like __init__, __str__, __add__. They're also called magic methods. Python automatically invokes them for specific operations, allowing customization of built-in behavior like object creation, string representation, operator overloading, and iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "--> Inheritance is an OOP concept where a child class acquires properties and methods of a parent class. This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes. The child class can extend or override the functionality of the parent class. Inheritance helps reduce redundancy and supports hierarchical classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "--> Polymorphism means \"many forms\" and allows objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface. It enables a single method name to behave differently based on the object calling it. This includes method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "--> Encapsulation in Python is achieved through naming conventions:\n",
        "Public: Normal attributes/methods (no underscore)\n",
        "Protected: Single underscore prefix (_attribute) - conventional protection\n",
        "Private: Double underscore prefix (__attribute) - name mangling makes it harder to access from outside\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "--> A constructor is a special method __init__() automatically called when creating a new object. It initializes the object's attributes and performs any setup needed. It receives self as the first parameter (referring to the instance) and any additional parameters for initialization.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "--> Class methods: Decorated with @classmethod, receive the class (cls) as the first parameter instead of the instance. Used for operations related to the class itself, like factory methods.\n",
        "Static methods: Decorated with @staticmethod, don't receive self or cls. They're utility functions logically related to the class but don't need access to class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "--> Python does not support traditional method overloading like Java. Instead, it achieves similar behavior using:\n",
        "-Default arguments\n",
        "-Variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs)\n",
        "This allows methods to handle different parameter inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "--> Method overriding is a feature of OOP where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type (if applicable), and parameters as the method in the superclass. This is a form of polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "--> The @property decorator converts a method into a \"getter\" for a read-only attribute. Combined with @attribute.setter and @attribute.deleter, it provides controlled access to private attributes, allowing validation and processing during get/set operations while maintaining a clean attribute-like syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism is important in OOP because it:\n",
        "-Allows the use of a single interface for different data types.\n",
        "-Enables code to be more general and reusable.\n",
        "-Improves code readability and flexibility.\n",
        "-Allows subclasses to define their own behavior, even when sharing a common interface with the base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "--> An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes. Created using the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module, it contains one or more abstract methods (decorated with @abstractmethod) that must be implemented by derived classes. It enforces a contract for subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "--> Advantages of OOP include:\n",
        "-Code reusability\n",
        "-Modularity\n",
        "-Easy maintenance\n",
        "-Better data security\n",
        "-Real-world problem modeling\n",
        "-It also simplifies debugging and testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "-Class variables: Shared across all instances of a class, defined directly in the class body. Changes affect all instances.\n",
        "-Instance variables: Unique to each instance, defined in __init__() using self. Each object has its own copy.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "--> Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. It enables combining features from multiple classes. Python resolves conflicts using the Method Resolution Order (MRO).\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of 'str' and 'repr' methods in Python.\n",
        "__str__(): Returns a user-friendly, readable string representation of the object, used by print() and str(). Designed for end users.\n",
        "__repr__(): Returns an unambiguous, developer-focused string representation, ideally valid Python code to recreate the object. Used by repr() and in interactive shells.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "--> The super() function allows access to parent class methods from a child class. It supports inheritance and avoids code duplication, especially in multiple inheritance scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the del method in Python?\n",
        "--> __del__() is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected). It's used for cleanup operations like closing files, releasing resources, or database connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "--> @staticmethod: Doesn't receive any implicit first argument, cannot access instance or class data. Used for utility functions related to the class.\n",
        "@classmethod: Receives the class (cls) as the first argument, can access and modify class state. Used for factory methods and operations on class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "-->In Python, polymorphism with inheritance is mainly achieved through Method Overriding. When a subclass inherits from a superclass and redefines a method that exists in the superclass, the method call will dynamically resolve to the subclass's version when called on an object of the subclass. This allows objects of different classes (that share a common parent) to respond to the same method call in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "--> Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement by having each method return self. This creates a fluent interface: obj.method1().method2().method3(). It makes code more concise and readable for sequential operations on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the call method in Python?\n",
        "--> The __call__() method makes an instance callable like a function. When you use parentheses on an object obj(), Python invokes obj.__call__(). This is useful for creating function-like objects, implementing decorators, or creating objects that maintain state between calls.\n",
